Only codes indented under conditional statements will be performed according to conditions in conditional statements
(I've spent quite a long time using a code that doesn't work because it doesn't even have a single indent.)

: (colon) must be added after if, elif, else, while, for ...

## if, elif, else
Use when you need to perform certain actions when you meet certain conditions.

Logical AND, OR, NOT
For conditions used in condition statements, logical AND, OR, NOT are available because it is a boolean.

### When condition is not boolean(None,0,0.0,'',[],(),{},set())

## loop

### while, for
Enables repetitive tasks.
Perform if certain conditions are met (while)
Use while touring items of collection type, such as lists, strings, and tuples (for)
*If you do not stop repeating when using (while), the cells will be performed indefinitely, requiring kernel reboot.
while performs a code block only if the condition after is 'True'. If 'False' then stop code block performance and perform subsequent code

### break
when use to stop loop
Performed within a conditional statement and used to escape a loop if conditions are met.

### continue
In certain cases, use to skip to the next, without performing any code.
